# Smart Washing Machine Ticket Counter System

## Abstract
Our project focuses on enhancing the Smart Washing Machine Ticket Counter System through the implementation of an adaptive machine learning (ML) algorithm. The primary goal is to refine waiting time estimations and optimize queue management using training set data and real-time insights. Additionally, the system provides notifications to users, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Features
- **Queue Optimization:** Real-time insights for effective queue management.
- **Training Set Data:** Incorporating data-driven approaches to improve system performance.
- **Adaptive Machine Learning:** Utilizing ML algorithms to enhance waiting time estimations.
- **User Notifications:** Keeping users informed about their washing machine queue status.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Smart Washing Machine Ticket Counter System, follow these steps:

1. **Log-in or Sign-up:** Visit our website and log in or sign up.
2. **Enter Clothes Details:** Specify the number of clothes to wash (shirts, pants, jackets, undergarments).
3. **Backend Computation:** The ML model computes washing time based on parameters, employing feature engineering for accuracy.
4. **Waiting Time Display:** Users are redirected to a new page displaying the computed waiting time.
5. **Email Notification:** Users receive a Gmail notification when their turn arrives, improving the token counter system effectively.

## Extendability and Future Development

- **Adding New Features:** Enhance system functionality by incorporating new features to improve the dataset and accuracy.
- **Scaling for Larger Deployments:** Extend the model to manage a network of washing machines for larger deployments.
- **IoT Involvement:** Implement current, water, or ultrasonic sensors for precise machine function determination, minimizing delays.
- **Conditioning Portal:** Set up a portal to address issues related to the functioning of the machine.
